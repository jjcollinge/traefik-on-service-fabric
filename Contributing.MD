# Contributing to Traefik on Service Fabric

> **Warning:**
Developing this solution is a non-trivial task especially if you are unfamiliar with the `golang`, [`dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep) and its tooling. We highly recommend taking the time to understand both `dep` and `golang` on a simpler project before starting.  

## Requirements

- Golang Environment: [Guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) **NOTE**: Ensure you have your [GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH) and other required environment variables configured.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) Installed
- Dep Installed: [Install Guide](https://github.com/golang/dep) and [How-to](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/introduction.html)
- Local Service Fabric cluster: [Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started-mac) or [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started)
- [Sample Application](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/service-fabric-dotnet-getting-started/) deployed into Service Fabric cluster
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Optional but recommended

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) with [Go Extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-go)
- [Delve](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/wiki/Debugging-Go-code-using-VS-Code) debugger installed and configured 

## Introduction

In this doc we will focus on setting up your dev environment and assume a working knowledge of the SF provider and Traefik. 

[This blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azureservicefabric/2018/04/05/intelligent-routing-on-service-fabric-with-traefik/) provides a good understanding of how the integration works and why it was written. It is highly recommended that you read the blog and [Traefik docs](https://docs.traefik.io/) before proceeding. 

The solution consists of several different github projects:

- [Traefik Extra Service Fabric](https://github.com/containous/traefik-extra-service-fabric): SF provider for Traefik
- [Service Fabric Go SDK](https://github.com/jjcollinge/servicefabric): SF Management SDK for Go
- [Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik): Builds the proxy  

The `Traefik` project imports `Traefik Extra Service Fabric` which in turn import the `Service Fabric Golang SDK` all using `dep` and versioned by CommitID pinning.

`Traefik (03ce6a) => Traefik Extra Service Fabric (29a6d7) => Service Fabric Golang SDK (8eebe1)`

To release an update of the `Service Fabric Golang SDK` a pull-request (PR) should be made to it's repository and once accepted `Traefik Extra Service Fabric`'s `gopkg.toml` can be update to reference this new CommitID and this change is PR'd. Then finally `Traefik` can be updated to reference this new version of `Traefik Extra Service Fabric`. While this provides the necessary control to version releases of `Traefik` this isn't a workable flow when developing.  

## Recommended Dev Setup

```
$ go get github.com/containous/traefik
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/containous/traefik

# `master` branch of `Traefik Extra Service Fabric` is compatible with `Traefik` v1.6+
$ git checkout v1.6
```

For local development you can simplify the flow by cloning both `Traefik Extra Service Fabric` and `Service Fabric Go SDK` into the `/vendor` folder of `Traefik`. This provides a quick and easy way to build/debug `Traefik` by making changes to `Traefik Extra Service Fabric` in the `/vendor` folder. These changes can then be checked in an pushed from each projects folder `/vendor/github.com/jjcollinge/servicefabric` for example. 

> **NOTE:** This is only a local solution to speed things up, the full flow is required for releases. 

> **NOTE:** Be aware that `golang` is sensitive to file paths so, even if you are working on a fork, you must ensure your `Traefik` instance is located at `$gopath/src/github.com/containous/traefik`

> **NOTE:** If you do work inside `Traefik`'s `/vendor` directory, it may be helpful to delete the `.git` folder inside `Traefik` to avoid confusion between the nested git repositories.

```
# replace vendored `containous/traefik-extra-service-fabric` folder with git repo
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/containous/traefik/vendor/github.com/containous
$ rm -r traefik-extra-service-fabric
$ git clone https://github.com/containous/traefik-extra-service-fabric

# replace vendored `jjcollinge/servicefabric` folder with git repo
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/containous/traefik/vendor/github.com/jjcollinge
$ rm -r servicefabric
$ git clone https://github.com/jjcollinge/servicefabric
```

## Building & Testing

> **WARNING:** Building the top level `traefik` solution can overwrite the `vendor` file and any changes in `traefik-service-fabric-extra` can be lost. This is caused by `make`. Ensure changes are pushed to a remote before attempting to build `traefik`. Be sure to use `go build ./cmd/traefik` to build rather than the `make` command. 

### Traefik

1. Follow [Traefik WebUI Build: How to build for backend devs](https://github.com/containous/traefik/tree/master/webui#how-to-build-for-backends-developer).

    **NOTE**: If you have an empty `/static` folder already delete it before running `make generate-ui`. This may fail on Windows, if so, please use a `bash` environment such as [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

    For the build to run with WSL you will also need to have the docker client installed in the WSL environment and the TCP port exposed on localhost from Docker for Windows.

    In WSL download the version of Docker that matches that of Docker for windows (should be the latest)
```
        wget https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/xenial/pool/stable/amd64/docker-ce_18.03.0~ce-0~ubuntu_amd64.deb

        sudo apt-get install libltdl7

        sudo dpkg -i ./docker-ce_18.03.0~ce-0~ubuntu_amd64.deb

        export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
```



2. Follow the [Traefik Guide: Method #2](https://github.com/containous/traefik/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#method-2-using-go)

### Testing `Traefik Extra Service Fabric` and the SDK

In the `traefik` directory run:
``` 
go test -v ./vendor/github.com/containous/traefik-extra-service-fabric/...
go test -v ./vendor/github.com/jjcollinge/servicefabric/...
```

## Debugging using VSCode

In your `Traefik` directory create the following files then hit `F5`. You can step and set breakpoints in both `Traefik` and the other packages in the `vendor` file.

`.vscode/launch.json`
``` json

            ],
            "showLog": true
        }
    ]
